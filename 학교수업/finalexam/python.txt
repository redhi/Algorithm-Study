파이썬에 대한 설명
파이썬[2](영어: Python)은 1991년[3] 프로그래머인 귀도 반 로섬[4]이 발표한 고급 프로그래밍 언어로, 플랫폼에 독립적이며 인터프리터식, 객체지향적, 동적 타이핑(dynamically typed) 대화형 언어이다. 파이썬이라는 이름은 귀도가 좋아하는 코미디 〈Monty Python's Flying Circus〉에서 따온 것이다.

Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. 
Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable 
use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as its 
object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical 
code for small and large-scale projects.

Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s, as a 
successor to the ABC programming language, and first released it 
in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and 
introduced new features, such as list comprehensions and a garbage 
collection system using reference counting. Python 3.0 was released 
in 2008 and was a major revision of the language that is not 
completely backward-compatible and much Python 2 code does not run 
unmodified on Python 3. Python 2 was discontinued with version 
2.7.18 in 2020.
